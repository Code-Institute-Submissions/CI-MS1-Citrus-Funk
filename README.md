## Description

This project is a site for my cousins band, Citrus Funk. It aims to promote their music and give them further exposure to help generate a larger fan base.

## UX

### User Stories

>  *"I’ve heard about this band and want to know more about them!*

>  *“I saw them at a gig, where can I find their social media?”*

>  *“A friend of mine recommended them, how do I book them?”*

>  *“I want to be able to see what songs they play and listen to their music.”*

>  *“I want to know who they are and where are they from.”*

### **Strategy**

#### External User's Goals

Current or potential fans who want to learn about the bands:
* *Music*
* *Repertoire*
* *Background*
* *Members*
* *Social Media*
* *Booking*
* *Pricing*
* *Location*

#### Site Owner's Goals

* *Expanding the bands brand*
* *Get more bookings*
* *Promote their music*

### **Scope**

Visually appealing website with lots of imagery.

Defines who the band members are, what's their music and where they can be found.

### **Structure**

I want to structure the site with a combination of images, video and short but informative paragraphs.

I want the site to link externally to their Youtube and other social media so user's can see and listen to their music.

There will also be a external PDF links to their full repertoire and pricing list.

There will be a contact form as well as another external link to a booking website.

## Project Barriers and Solutions

- Initial home page wireframe had the headings/text right of center. Due to a slight colour clash with the background image I changed it to being left of center.
- Had an issue with pushing a video as the file was too big. I edited the file and then changed it but still had a problem with the previous commit. [JimLynx](https://github.com/JimLynx) from Code Institute Slack group helped me with this [Stack Overflow link.](
