### Project Barriers and Solutions

- Initial home page wireframe had the headings/text right of center. Due to a slight colour clash with the background image I changed it to being left of center.
- Had an issue with pushing a video as the file was too big. I edited the file and then changed it but still had a problem with the previous commit. [JimLynx](https://github.com/JimLynx) from Code Institute Slack group helped me with this [Stack Overflow link.](
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4114095/how-do-i-revert-a-git-repository-to-a-previous-commit)
- As I was working through the site I changed the background colours around several times. I eventually settled on what I felt was most appealing, which includes background images on the repertoire and gallery page sections.
- Due to the fixed navbar, there was an overlap when I clicked each in page link. This [Stack Overflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4086107/fixed-page-header-overlaps-in-page-anchors) helped me solve the issue. 
- There was an issue with overlapping text on the home page when viewed on a landscape mobile. To solve this I used trial and error with Chrome Dev Tools and eventually came to the solution of removing the height of the background container and placing top and bottom padding on the header. 
- The promo video has been cropped to help with the speed of the site.
- The background image for the home page has been compressed multiple times to try and speed up the site.

### Feature To Improve

- External links to PDFs have spelling errors and use the old band logo. These were provided to me by my cousin who is in the band.
- The external promo video uses their old logo. Once the band record an update, this could be added.
- Use a wider variety of icons, such as a trombone for the band members. I was limited to the free FontAwesome icons.
- Despite compressing images multiple times and shortening the promo video, the site might be a bit slow.
- Form submission. (Currently don't have the skills)
