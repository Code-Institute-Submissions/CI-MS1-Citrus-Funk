Visually appealing website with lots of imagery.

Defines who the band members are, what's their music and where they can be found.

I want to structure the site with a combination of images, video and short but informative paragraphs.

I want the site to link externally to their Youtube and other social media so user's can see and listen to their music.

There will also be a external PDF links to their full repertoire and pricing list.

There will be a contact form as well as another external link to a booking website.
